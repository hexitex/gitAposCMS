# Changelog

## 1.1.1 2020-08-26

* Areas with `edit: false` caused a situation where the area structure modal would not function properly. In addition, areas appearing twice on the page confused the module. These issues have been fixed.
* Workflow compatibility: the `workflowModified` property is now set to true when this module modifies an area.
* Adds the package-lock.json file to `.gitignore` and deletes it.

## 1.1.0 2020-08-12

* New edit button scrolls to the widget in question and triggers the editing dialog box and/or clicks on the rich text to activate the editor.
* No more override of `area.html`, better compatibility with new developments there in the core.


## 1.0.0 — 1.0.3

* Original release and bug fixes.
